# About Me

How do we use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create a website? As Dan Lawrence (2022) points out, self-teaching is "the most important skill for any professional," and we must "learn to become a patient and resourceful self-teacher" (pp. 42-43). Thus, we'll take a learn-as-go approach to coding. I'll help you along the way, but the best way to learn how to code is to try, troubleshoot, and revise.

The content in this folder, modeled after Stephen Quigley's (2022) [Open Fuego coding tool](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/26.2/disputatio/quigley/openfuego.html), will help you learn how to code and draft the About Me portion of your final project.

You'll work through the prompts in the index.html file to construct a webpage that introduces who you are. Imagine you're presenting this webpage to a future employer. Your About Me should tell them what your values and principles are, and how such qualities connect to your work as a professional writer.

I encourage you to play and explore. Coding can be frustrating, but it's highly rewarding when your piece goes live.
